== Restconf analysis

==== Removing web.xml and singletons

https://jersey.java.net/nonav/documentation/1.17/user-guide.html#d4e188[Deploying a RESTful Web Service with Jersey 1.17]

* *removing web.xml*
** using annotation ApplicationPath from Servlet 3.0
*** this is not possible with jersey 1.17 and jetty
**** need to migrate to jersey v2
*** not possible to remove singletons
**** jersey initiated applications (java classes extended by Application) while jersey's bundle starts
***** we can use *load on startup* in web.xml for specific servlet but it does not solve the problem
***** jersey start in aaa-shiro

* *removing singletons*
** we don't have to use web.xml and annotations
** this is possible only on jersey v2

[red]#The best way of removing web xml and singletons is migrating to jersey 2.x#
