* *removing web.xml*
** using annotation ApplicationPath from Servler 3.0
*** this is not possible with jersey 1.17 and jetty
**** need to migrate to jersey v2
*** not possible to remove singletons
**** jersey initiated applications (java classes extended by Application) while jersey's bundle starts
***** jersey start in aaa-shiro

* *removing singletons*
** we dont have to use web.xml and annotations
** this is possible only on jersey v2
